        </div>
        <div class="content-paragraph">
            <p class="about-p">Postanote.org allows you to create simple, one-page websites where anyone can anonymously post to Nostr with random accounts. 
                Whether for feedback, reviews, questions or suggestions, visitors can quickly engage by scanning a QR code or tapping an NFC tag. 
                There's no need for them to understand Nostr – it's seamless and intuitive. Posts are routed through private or public relays. 
                Hashtags make these posts searchable and accessible across the Nostr network or within a select group, depending on the chosen settings. A discovery client is currently in development to let users find 
                and explore posts by others more easily. More features are on the way to enhance how content is shared and discovered.

            <h3>For Visitors</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content-paragraph">
            <p class="about-p">Welcome! Visiting a Postanote page is as easy as scanning a QR code or tapping an NFC tag. The non-custom page won't do much, and posting from the main page is restricted to prevent spam.  
                However, if you land on a custom page, you can share your thoughts or leave feedback completely anonymously.  
                It's fast, straightforward, and respects your privacy by generating a random Nostr ID that stays on your device.  
                If the term "Nostr" sounds unfamiliar, don't worry – all you need to know is how to read and press a button or two.  
                Your unique keys remain on your device and can be exported if you choose to explore Nostr further – or wiped if you'd prefer to create a new one. The choice is yours.  
                Everything you post will live on the Nostr protocol and can be discovered through hashtags #cat #photography etc. Most user-friendly Nostr clients include a search option.  
                Nostr is a space where you can speak freely without censorship, and you own your account unlike traditional platforms like Twitter where can take your account down whenever they like.
                I highly encourage you to learn more about Nostr. It's awesome and kind.

        </div>
        <div class="content-paragraph">
            <p class="about-p">Hey, Maker! With Postanote, you're in charge. Craft custom URLs that suit your needs – whether for events, product feedback, crowdsourced ideas, questions... 
                You decide the style, character limits, hashtags, and which relays to post through. Non-technical users can easily leave posts on Nostr for the things you need a feedback or a boost for. 
                As more features roll out, your pages will evolve with new tools for engagement and creativity. This is your chance to build interactive, anonymous spaces that connect people to Nostr.
