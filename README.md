# Yoooo!

What's this all about is coming sometime in the near future. Stay humble in the meantime!

# Quick word what's all about...
__Custom URLs for NFC or QR codes, random ID posting to Nostr, Normies doesn't need to know all the details to use Nostr. Visitor of the custom link will just click that post btn with running ostrich and the note will be published! Quick custom website for reviews and other stuff just with URL attributes. Search client is comming too, but first I need to clean this messy code of current POC__
