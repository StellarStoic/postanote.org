                    The "Your Content" section is where you present your content to the end user. You can type freely and structure it as you like.  
                    <br><br>
                    You can embed Nostr notes and npub profiles by adding a prefix:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>nostr:note1t9wfaksdutq0hlnvqpzud5cq4wm9574mey0ykg3ju65stgezvsds56fg9z</code></li>
                        <li><code>nostr:npub1sg6plzptd64u62a878hep2kev88swjh3tw00gjsfl8f237lmu63q0uf63m</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    Only the <code>note1...</code> format is supported—sorry!  
                    <br><br>
                    You can also include links to images or videos to display them in your custom page. Both Vimeo and YouTube links are supported and will generate thumbnails.  
                    <br><br>
                    QR codes can be embedded using the <code>qr:</code> prefix, such as <code>qr:somethingSomething</code>. Some QR codes can include logos, which are used with specific prefixes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>bitcoin:</code></li>
                        <li><code>lightning:</code></li>
                        <li><code>ecash:</code></li>
                        <li><code>monero:</code></li>
                    </ul>
                    (If you think more should be added, let me know.)  
                    <br><br>
                    Links starting with <code>https://</code> will be formatted to open on click.  
                    <br><br>
                    Note: Script tags are not supported in this section. If you attempt to post code, the URL will be invalid for the end user. If you must share code, take a screenshot and upload it as an image link instead.

            <div class="faq-question showhistory" onclick="toggleFaq('faq4')">
                <a href="#faqShowHistory">What are all the features in ShowHistory?</a>
            </div>
            <div id="faq4" class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    The <strong>ShowHistory</strong> section contains all the Nostr events you have posted.  
                    <br><br>
                    If you have created and used multiple Nostr IDs, each ID will have a different **color** to distinguish them. Each ID is given a **randomly generated name**, which consists of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A random adjective</li>
                        <li>A random noun</li>
                        <li>A random number from <strong>01 to 21</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    This name is always displayed under your avatar like <strong>weepy_bumph_13</strong>.  
                    <br><br>
                    In the ShowHistory section, you will see a **number** in front of each name, which represents the **total number of notes** you have posted with that specific ID.  
                    <br><br>
                    The details also include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your **private key** (masked with <code>*****</code> for security). Click to reveal it.</li>
                        <li>A **QR code** on the other side, which allows you to easily import the ID into any Nostr client.</li>
                        <li>Basic **Nostr event details** (following <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md" target="_blank">Kind 1 Nostr Events</a> specifications).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <strong>I am aware of the security risks associated with storing private keys in plain sight, but these are disposable IDs, and you should treat them as such.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Extra Features:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A large **Download** button at the top to export your full history in JSON format.</li>
                        <li>A **Delete All (Panic Button)** at the bottom if you want to erase everything quickly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="faq-question index" onclick="toggleFaq('faq5')">
                <a href="#faqNotePosting">I posted a Note, but where did it go?</a>

                    When you post a response (a note), you receive feedback containing the event details. The note has been broadcasted to Nostr relays and is now part of Nostr forever.
                    <br><br>
                    You have several options to search for your note:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the <a href="https://snofl.com/client.com" target="_blank">search client</a> to look up similar content.</li>
                        <li>Copy the event ID in the event details and search for it manually.</li>
                        <li>Visit <a href="https://njump.me" target="_blank">njump.me</a> using the buttons below the event details.</li>
                        <li>Copy the event ID with a button bellow the event details and search for it manually.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If you lost track of your posted note details, don't worry. All your posted notes are stored in the ShowHistory section, located in the footer below.</p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="faq-question client" onclick="toggleFaq('faq6')"><a href="#faqAboutClient">You say there's a search client?</a></div>
            <div id="faq6" class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Yes, you can use the <a href="https://snofl.com/client.html" target="_blank">search client</a> to look up content on Nostr relays that support 
                    <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/50.md" target="_blank">NIP-50</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    You can search using multiple keywords, either combined or separately.  
                    You can toggle the view by keyword, or even block publishers you don't like.  
                    <br><br>
                    It's still a work in progress, so some features may not work as expected.  
                    <strong>Reactions don’t work yet</strong>, and things are still a bit clunky because, honestly, I suck at understanding WebSockets. 😅

                    and is used globally to protect sensitive data, including government and financial information.
                </p>
                <h4>🔐 What Makes AES-256 Strong?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Length:</strong> AES-256 uses a 256-bit encryption key, offering 2<sup>256</sup> possible combinations. 
                        This is a number so large that even modern supercomputers would take <strong>billions of years</strong> to brute-force it.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Cryptographic Strength:</strong> AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for encryption 
                        and decryption. This simplicity ensures high speed without compromising security.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Best Practices for Maximum Security</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a password with a minimum of 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.</li>
                    <li>Avoid common words, predictable phrases, or keyboard patterns.</li>
                    <li>Store passwords in a secure <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">password manager</a> instead of relying 
                        on memory.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>A Brief History of AES</h4>
                <p>
                    AES was established as the encryption standard by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. 
                    It replaced the older DES 
                    (Data Encryption Standard) due to advancements in computing power that made DES vulnerable. AES was selected through a 
                    global competition and is based 
                    on the Rijndael cipher, designed by cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
                </p>
                <h4>Why Privacy Matters</h4>
                <p>
                    Protecting sensitive information like URLs ensures that your personal data and activity remain private. 
                    Encryption plays a crucial role in safeguarding secure links and confidential content, providing peace of 
                    mind that unauthorized access is nearly impossible.

                    However, centralized institutions have a poor reputation for securely storing personal data, highlighting 
                    the need for individuals to take control of their privacy. While encryption is a powerful tool, it’s only 
                    as strong as its weakest link—humans. Mistakes, phishing, and social engineering can compromise even the 
                    most robust security systems.
                    
                    Empowering users with knowledge and awareness is just as important as using strong encryption.</p>
                <p>
                    Always remember: <strong>The strength of encryption depends on the strength of your password, your opsec and people you share this password with!</strong>
